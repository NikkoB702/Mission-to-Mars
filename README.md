# Mission-to-Mars

## Deliverable 1

##### Scrape titles and preview text from Mars News

Using Splinter and Beautiful Soup we were asked to scrape the [Mars News] (https://redplanetscience.com/) website. Specifically, scrape the title and preview text and optionally store the scraped data in either a JSON file or a MongoDB database.

## Deliverable 2

##### Scrape and analyze Mars weather data

Using our original webscraping dependencies as well as Pandas and Matplotlib we were asked to scrape the [Mars Temperature Data] (https://data-class-mars-challenge.s3.amazonaws.com/Mars/index.html) and answer the following questions;
  
  * How many months exist on Mars?
  * How many Martian (and not Earth) days worth of data exist in the scraped dataset?
  * What are the coldest and the warmest months on Mars (at the location of Curiosity)?
  * Which months have the lowest and the highest atmospheric pressure on Mars? 
  * About how many terrestrial (Earth) days exist in a Martian year? That is, in the time that Mars circles the Sun once, how many days elapse on Earth?
  
  We were then asked to export our DataFrame into a CSV file.
